# Data Science in practice

<div align="justify">

This repository aims to collect super useful packages and resources for any language, framework and software used for data science. I hope you find this collection useful - feel free to subscribe and send me an email if you have feedback or would like to join forces in any way! **Please cite this repository when using its resources.**

## Other such lists

* **[Awesome R.](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R)** A super-good list of very similar nature to the list found in this Repo for packages, tutorials and many other things related to R. This repo has a great website [here](https://awesome-r.com/).

* **[CRAN Task Views.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)** "CRAN task views aim to provide some guidance which packages on CRAN are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic. They give a brief overview of the included packages and can be automatically installed using the ctv package. The views are intended to have a sharp focus so that it is sufficiently clear which packages should be included (or excluded) - and they are not meant to endorse the "best" packages for a given task."
