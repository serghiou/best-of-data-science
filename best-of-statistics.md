# Best of Statistics

## Learning

**[Modern Statistics for Modern Biology.](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/)** Book. An open book containing the essentials of modern statistical approaches to data analysis in biology. I love the interface, the comments on the side, the seamlessly integrated questions/answers and the examples of R code.

**[Elementary Statistics by Penn State.](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat200/home)** Course. Book. This is a superbly well designed course on statistics, which also emphasizes the computational approach to learning statistics (e.g. simulations). I would have liked they used a less traditional approach in describing statistical significance. Nevertheless, very highly recommended.

**[Ask Good Questions.](https://askgoodquestions.blog/)** Blog. A blog about teaching introductory statistics. It has great explanations about aspects of statistics that students frequently get wrong. I really like the clever statistical problems that it has and it's a great inspiration for exam questions.


## Frequentist

**[Regression and ANOVA.](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jtaylo/courses/stats203/)** Tutorial. These are the materials of the main regression analysis course at Stanford at the Masters level. A good overview of the most important methods and of resources you can use to extend your knowledge.

  
## Bayesian statistics

**[fiveMinuteStats.](https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/index.html)** Tutorial. Examples. An astonishing resource of really good code and explanation of advanced topics in statistics (e.g. mixture models, Gibbs sampling, etc.). Even though this is relevant to frequentist statistcs as well, it mostly contains Bayesian examples. Super highly recommended!

**[Multi-Armed Bandits, Conjugate Models and Bayesian Reinforcement Learning.](https://eigenfoo.xyz/bayesian-bandits/)** Tutorial. Examples. A fantastic website on applying Bayesian methods and Bandits. The website belongsn to George Ho, who also provides great Python code to implement theory.

**[Introduction to Bayesian Networks.](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-networks-81031eeed94e)** Tutorial. A great brief article introduction to Bayesian Networks on Medium - it has received 2.7K claps.



## Statistical practice

**[“We continuously increased the number of animals until statistical significance was reached to support our conclusions” . . . I think this is not so bad, actually.](https://andrewgelman.com/2018/09/04/continuously-increased-number-animals-statistical-significance-reached-support-conclusions-think-not-bad-actually-2/)** A very interesting thread on whether sequential data collection for as long as it takes for the data to look good is permissible. Andrew Gelman argues that it is, only if the analysis takes this sequential nature into account - if it does not, then the approach is pretty much guaranteed to yield a desirable result.



## Statistical computing

**[Advanced Statistical Computing.](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/advstatcomp/)** A work in progress by Roger Peng of Johns Hopkins University. This is the book containing the material that he teaches in his statistical computing class to Biostatistics PhD students.
