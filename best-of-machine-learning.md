## Calibration

* **[Meta-learning in finance: boosting models calibration with deep learning](https://medium.com/@alexrachnog/meta-learning-in-finance-boosting-models-calibration-with-deep-learning-47c98d0d158c)** Tutorial. A good intro to model calibration using machine learning and good basic code to implement what is said in the article on Medium.


## TensorFlow

* **[What-If Tool.](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/the-what-if-tool-code-free-probing-of.html?m=1)** This looks like a must-use tool when using TensorFlow to build a new model. As per the blog post "Building effective machine learning (ML) systems means asking a lot of questions. It's not enough to train a model and walk away. Instead, good practitioners act as detectives, probing to understand their model better: How would changes to a datapoint affect my model’s prediction? Does it perform differently for various groups–for example, historically marginalized people? How diverse is the dataset I am testing my model on?"


## Interpretability

* **[Interpretable Machine Learning.](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)** Book. A great introductory overview of the field written in a beautifully looking bookdown format.
