# Text editors

<div align="justify">

New text editors appear all the time. This is a list of text editors I find particularly good. If you happen to read this, please contribute any text editors you do not see here, but which you like! I hope you find this resource useful.

## Markdown

* **[stackedit.](https://stackedit.io/app#)** Free. Open Source. Neat editor with good features, including sharing, working on a document concurrently, maintaining a version history and commenting. I would have liked to be able to easily export to Word (and vice versa) and to be able to align justify.

* **[Stencila.](https://stenci.la/)** Free. This appears super cool, even though I have not used it yet. It looks great for authoring Markdown documents in conjunction with underlying data science code and your data in order to produce live documents; almost like a better-looking version of R-Markdown.

## LaTeX

* **[Overleaf/ShareLaTeX.](https://www.overleaf.com/)** The best editor for LaTeX I have found so far. It makes creating such documents super easy. Love the integration with GitHub and how easy to makes it to cite.

* **[Thesis template.](https://github.com/dcroote/stanford-thesis-example)** A template created by a Stanford graduate to help others write their thesis in LaTeX painlessly.

## JavaScript

* **[Observable.](https://observablehq.com/)** A beautiful editor for JavaScript that lets you create visualizations of data easily and interactively.

## General coding

* **[Vim](https://medium.com/better-programming/vim-isnt-that-scary-here-are-5-free-resources-you-can-use-to-learn-it-5bba109a7422)** Free. Tutorial. Vim is probably the most used text editor for programmers. Even though it has a steep learning curve, it comes with great functionality. This tutorial is a good start.
