**[Python Graph Gallery.](https://python-graph-gallery.com/)** Vignette. Educational. Another superb website created by Yan Holtz. It is a gallery of all sorts of different types of graphs created using different specifications. I like how it gives suggestions at the end indicating that if you are interested in this type of plot, you may also be interested in this other type of plot. I derive lots of benefit by browsing through this website even for simple plots for ideas of how to make them look nicer. An unbelievable resource and a must in the armamentarium of anyone working with data. I think the respective R Gallery is slightly more developed than this and uses multiple packages (unlike this one, which only uses `seaborn` as of April 2019).

**[Data-to-Viz.](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)** Vignette. Educational. This is a beautiful and SUPERB website created by Yan Holtz including all sorts of different plots you might imagine alongside the required code to produce them and, most importantly, ways to avoid caveats/mistakes usually done when using such plots. An unbelievable resource and a must in the armamentarium of anyone working with data.

**[Reviewing Python Visualization Packages](https://towardsdatascience.com/reviewing-python-visualization-packages-fa7fe12e622b)** Review. A good overview of visualization packages available for Python and their basic use.
