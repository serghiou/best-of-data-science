# Best of Python

<div align="justify">

A collection of useful resources and packages.


## To learn Python

**[Learning Data Science: Our Favorite Python Resources.](https://hackernoon.com/learning-data-science-our-favorite-python-resources-from-free-to-not-877fca5c92f0)** Overview. An overview of resources to learn more about Python by Hackernoon on Medium.



***

## IDE/Distributions

**[Python distributions.](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3267976/python/anaconda-cpython-pypy-and-more-know-your-python-distributions.amp.html)** Collection. A good collection of Python distributions and their use cases. The commonest distribution of Python is CPython.



***

## Syntax

**[Commenting best practice.](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/)** Tutorial. A great explanation with examples of how to comment in Python and how to make sure that you are including appropriate (not too many, not too few) comments in your code.




## Text mining




## Data manipulation

**[Pandas.](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/tidyverse-style-pandas.html)** Tutorial. This is a fantastic tutorial on how to translate code from R's Tidyverse to Python Pandas.





## Data import/export

**[The most time efficient ways to import CSV data in Python.](https://medium.com/casual-inference/the-most-time-efficient-ways-to-import-csv-data-in-python-cc159b44063d)** Tutorial. A great exploration of ways to import CSV files in Python, contrasting straight forward approaches, versus speedy approaches. [This website](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining.html) offers a great illustration of how to implement method chaining/piping that has been popularized by tidyverse in R.




## Data description/summarization





## Data visualization

**[Python Graph Gallery.](https://python-graph-gallery.com/)** Vignette. Educational. Another superb website created by Yan Holtz. It is a gallery of all sorts of different types of graphs created using different specifications. I like how it gives suggestions at the end indicating that if you are interested in this type of plot, you may also be interested in this other type of plot. I derive lots of benefit by browsing through this website even for simple plots for ideas of how to make them look nicer. An unbelievable resource and a must in the armamentarium of anyone working with data. I think the respective R Gallery is slightly more developed than this and uses multiple packages (unlike this one, which only uses `seaborn` as of April 2019).

**[Data-to-Viz.](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)** Vignette. Educational. This is a beautiful and SUPERB website created by Yan Holtz including all sorts of different plots you might imagine alongside the required code to produce them and, most importantly, ways to avoid caveats/mistakes usually done when using such plots. An unbelievable resource and a must in the armamentarium of anyone working with data.

**[Reviewing Python Visualization Packages](https://towardsdatascience.com/reviewing-python-visualization-packages-fa7fe12e622b)** Review. A good overview of visualization packages available for Python and their basic use.









## Data analysis

**[Kaggle: Faster Data Science Education.](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)** Tutorial. A fantastic set of tutorials on all of the tools required, from Python to Pandas to Deep Learning. A highly-recommended resource, especially for those with minimal previous exposure to programming and machine learning.




## Bayesian Statistics

**[Bayesian Data Analysis in Python.](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)** Tutorial. A great resource with applied guidance on how to produce Bayesian analyses in Python.
